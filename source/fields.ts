So my newest concept is:
I cache the field of a dipole. Dipole because all my transistors are globally not charged?
Scrap that. So I just evaluate the field of a charged wire ( E = 1/r ) as an array.
I place my metal shape with opposite charge into this field, or ah who cares, so I use a square boundray,
and set the potential on it according to the wire potential.
So I place this U=homogenous metal object in there and calculate charge distribution.
These are the linear Poisson equations  collapsed over U => so it cannot be inverted for the time being.
Charge is on the other side of the equation. Or is it? No Charge is on the right side,
and only the sum (1) is on the left side ( and all the 0 for the dielectric space around the metal)
Now the matrix can be inverted again.
Collapsing n U -> 1 U
Shifting n Q -> to the right   and   add one row
Check!

How did I come to this? Ah right I have multiple objects. I have point charge carrier (wire) or an electrode.
The carrier moves or the electrode gets charged ( sum of all charges in transistor leads to stray field in the wires, yeah should be so, Lets look at the rails. Rails are supposed to have zero impedance! So of course there is input charge in a CMOS gate!)
Then there is a second electode nearby ( for the gating of the carriers).
The equation is like the one above, just on dielectric pixel has a Q=1
  recalc for moving Q .. or move metal (along surface)
  LU does not reuse results for pivot. Pivot is dominated by the dielectric. Real pivot is only needed in the range of collaped U and .. Q takes the place of the diagonal there.

  So Housten we are back at premature optimization. Out matrix does not need pivot.
  I do not need scary permutation matrices, I could also just do rows and columns in my order,
  by first only doing the dielectric and canceling any row that would touch metal (by clearing).
  So for the next inversion, I do reuse, reuse , ah I better check beforehand up to what point I want to reuse. 

How do I center? For carrier on metal: center on carrier.
For that I would calculate the halo around each carrier. On the border will be a discrepancy which iteratively will be solved ..
but wouldn't it be more sensible to collect all carrier fields on borders and the jump to the next border?
Yeah, her it comes:

If I do Direchlet boundary anyway, I can do blocks. I clear out complete blocks an recreate them using matrix multiplication.
So I use boundary of other blocks (closed interval) from last frame / last stepping?
If you think about it, doing Poisson single cell just applies this to a single cell.

So the boundary puts lots of U on the left side, on straight lines the outside potential just add up to the charge just inside.
So the boundary acts like a line of charge. I mean I estimate 50% duty area, so most cells will be charged.

Do I need electrode - electrode simulations? Probably not, though specs talk about C_{GS} and such.
But I can reuse the result quite efficiently.
While for carrier I need to recalc for every carrier position * electrode config,
here I only have elctrode config.
I have some more U callapsing ( and replacement by variable Q).

The funny thing is that I can cut my simulation result to a small block and it still makes sense.
Instead of the default simulation far of, I have the real boundary values in that state.

These "Green Function" ( not retarded, Maxwell and time is not in play yet )
