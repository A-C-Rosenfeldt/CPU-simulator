        <p> 320x240px.
            DAC: RGB 444 ( period correct for CGA sort of )
            8x8 tiles with 1 or 2 colors.
            Smooth scroll 0..7px ( push; delay buffer ). Rough scroll ( pull; memory start address, pitch, wrap bit depth;).
            Rough is bufferd: Atomic write for all by setting smooth 0XXX0YYY reg.
            4 layers aka z-values.
            1 byte/px (1 byte RLE for transparency / Color Keying) sprite overlay with these
            color formats: RGBI 2222 + 3 cycles of 223
            Also possible: combine with background to generate RGB 333.
            16 sprites per scanline. Unlimited height and width due to realtime data loading into 9bit/pixel FIFO

            Integer zoom is used to create large bosses within the memory bandwidth limit. Fractional zoom using Bresenham is
            used for Hang Out billboards. Also the street is created using zoomed horizontal spans. With the camera fixed on the track, texture is mostly aligned to the scanlines, but does not need to be rigidly.
            The X-positions of texture V ordinate crossings can be calculated on the CPU and with all sprites zoom-able, like 4 crossings are realistic. So the street need not be pinned,
            but true 3d calculation can be used.

            In this kind of game all sprites overlap on a scanline. 16 sprites suffices already for hangout, but not out run.
            Anyway, the simple byte buffer format allows the CPU to software render the far away spot into a frame buffer. Scenery in these old games clung to the street.

        floating point matrix rotation for sine tones. The floating point is implemented
        by only acting every 1,2,4,8 cycle.
        Matrix multiplication is even done less times.
        Overtones drown in noise of 1% noise of PWM + edge shifter (diagonal)
