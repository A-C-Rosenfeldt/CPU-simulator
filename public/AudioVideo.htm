        <p> 320x240px. 
            DAC: RGB 444 ( period correct for CGA sort of )
            8x8 tiles with 1 or 2 colors.
            Smooth scroll 0..7px ( push; delay buffer ). Rough scroll ( pull; memory start address, pitch, wrap bit depth;).
            Rough is bufferd: Atomic write for all by setting smooth 0XXX0YYY reg. 
            4 layers aka z-values.
            1 byte/px (1 byte RLE for transparency) sprite overlay with these
            color formats: RGBI 2222 + 3 cycles of 223
            Also possible: combine with background to generate RGB 333.
            16 sprites per scanline. Unlimited height and width due to realtime data loading into 9bit/pixel FIFO
        </p>
           <p>
                I would love to have affine texture mapped, gouraud triangles for 3d racing games: subpixel precise floor texture, copper like color bars. Bildboards.

        floating point matrix rotation for sine tones. The floating point is implemented
        by only acting every 1,2,4,8 cycle.
        Matrix multiplication is even done less times.
        Overtones drown in noise of 1% noise of PWM + edge shifter (diagonal)
