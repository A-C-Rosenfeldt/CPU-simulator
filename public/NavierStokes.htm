		<p>Beam crossing looks ugly, hence not particle effect for electrons.
			Instead I do semiconductor: electron density on a grid.
			I start with JS (TS really).
			I dunno, is the GL shader language readable for complex stuff?

		<p>Seems like JS timer, canvas, and canvas.drawImage() are low power consumption.

		<h2>2d case</h2>
		<p>
isotropie:	flow with fixed velocity.
Impulse flow over the borders of the cells (because we chose to use a grid): velocity * impulse_density.

		</p>
		<p>
Newton axioms: Delta_P due to state across border leads to delta_impulse of the flow.
Also electric field * density leads to delta_impulse.
state: looks like Density determines Pressure (and via Poisson the electric field).
Circular path which we just follow iteratively. I don't really have a temperature, do I?
We already took into account the field across cells, but also need to look inside a cell.
State equeation!
With charge in 2d pressure is .. 2d is so difficult.
With more charge carriers, we get more electric field. So force = density ( n / cell ) .. ah per particle.
Pressure is per line. So pressure is = n^2 ? Funny not to consider collisions. Feels a bit wrong because with more electrons they are closer to each other and a shorter mean path and I guess P = n^4 .
Finite integral over 1/x (force in 2d) is 1/x^2 . Where can I integrate this? Ah, nope ,
the small x don't exist due to repulsion and the large don't due to cell size.

	Check effect of state isotropie : circular waves .
