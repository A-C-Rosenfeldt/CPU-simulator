    Simulating an 1982 home computer with 
    a <a href="public/ISA.htm">6502 converted to load store</a>
    and <a href="public/AudioVideo.htm"> Audio and Video  </a> .

    <h2>About that 6502</h2>
    <p>
    I have to admit that I don't like the 6502 so much anymore (I like the flags, though. And the branches including the later branch always). It uses at least two cycles for every instruction,
    so it could just as well use 16 bit instruction words as minimum length and encode some register fields.
    The 8080 has 8 registers (AL, AH, BL, BH ..), which come in pairs. We only need 9 bits to address 3 of them.
    We could have a thenth bit to select between byte or word like on 8086. So there would be 4 more purely 16 bit registers, like
    BP, SP, SI, DI. Then not accesible by this there are also Instruction Pointer with own write back register, Stack Pointer,
    and the ALU write back register. So 16 x 16 bit x (+support) 8 transistors = 2^(4+4+3=10+1) = 2048 transistors.
    I became a MIPS fan, just that I read that interrupts need to be disabled while we process a delay slot.
    So what? The 6502 does complex address mode calculations which cannot be interrupted.
    For a budget CPU we need to share memory. Extra cache logic like MIPS is too expensive.
    Instead this CPU uses variable length instructions (CISC) for memory access.
    To keep the CPU regular it is probably best to avoid addressing modes.
    With two source registers, how do I even specify an offset for store? With 16 bit encoding, how can I supply a constant?
    With only one target register, how am I allowed to INC the address on LOAD ? Why did ARM drop this?
    When I use two cycles for memory access, then I can write back two values!
    Constant are loaded like in MIPS and RISCV with LoadLow 12bit and load high 4 bit. Or SH2 load 8 bit into low|high ?
    Also: No zero register.
    Yeah, sorry folks. If you need a constant, you've got to make sure that you loaded it into the register.
    </p>
    <p>
        I still wonder if I should aim for some 8 bit instructions. So bookkeeping which needs a lot of simple instructions. Like INC, DEC, SHL.
        Those could have single byte, single 16bit register encodings. I would also love to support for &= and += in one byte. So 6 bits for register.
        Basically the opCode is like (uhh sounds very CISC): bit 0 set , then it is += stuff. Bit 1 set, then it is INC stuff. Otherwise: 2 bytes .
        For a clean display of the inner workings it is better to got with 16 bit bus and no 8 bit instructions.
        Maybe addressing modes are really the way to go: We get a write back cycle because memory access needs two cycles. 
        So basically we can combine any artihmetic instruction with a Load Store instruction.
        Source or target register involved can be used for the Address ( pre vs post increment ) register (all 16 bit).
        So for the += and ++ stuff the source / target distinction becomes really blurred. Basically we only name 3 registers,
        one of which is a pure source. One source defines the byte (data) vs word (address, key), the other can be used to dump results.
        CMP and Test already feature a 0 target register. Some instructions target the instructionPointer. So decoding needs 4 bits anyway.
        CISC on x86 is complicated due to the encoding. People love addressing modes even on RISC. So clearly better keep fixed length instruction, but allow the "source" to be used as data target in Load.

        What does a branch instruction do with two source registers? Conditional flag code needs to be in the first byte.
        Condition is 3 bit .. so the opcode in the first byte is 2 bit and:
        jump / branch ( interpret second reg as condition ), ALU with b/w flag.
        Jumps can optionally move InstrucitonPointer to target and source to instructionPointer.
        So what is the second byte: TargetAddress or condition ? So we have 3 immediate instructions: LoadLow, LoadHigh, Branch
        Branch is important and should get large jumps ( word address, 00 interpreted as 100 etc.).
        So jump also allows a conditional field ( like some others probably) and then only has target register in the second byte
            ( or allow stack addressing modes ?). I don't really know .. maybe allow immediate offset?

        A lot of processors don't have the simple source-target assignment as MIPS and RISCV and I think that this would never work on 16bit encoding.        
    </p>
    <h2>Immediate values</h2>
    <p>
        So I came to the conclusion that the complicated immediate value of RISCV is justified. Likewise SH2 byte values.
        A branch instruction ( not in MIPS style, but with flags ) only has to encode 3 bits. So 11 bits can be immediates?
        Jump instructions are absolute in 6502. So I propose that you need to load one byte into a reg8 and then Jump loads 
        the other byte as immediate. Jump can also work on 16bit registers: for switch as input and for target as link. Or both.
        Since Jump needs to specify two regs=6 bit, it can only have a 8 bit immediate value.
        Load needs to store its stuff somewhere and in vain of 8080, we store stuff in 8 bit regs.
        Some reg,reg -> reg instruction would optionally need a immediate value in the first place, but we have only 4 bits:
        widthFlag|reg). Or basically:  Width==8?  reg :  immediate ? 3 bit signed :  reg pair.
        LoadStore for 6502 memory mapped IO would want absolute immediates like jump,
        while LoadStore into datastructures wants to be an option on an arithmetic function:
        write back to source1, use target for the data in memory. For const offset there is only a reg field => 4 bits.
        </p>
        <p>
            With fully symmetric registers, I could enforce that the register used to hold the high-byte for jump and Load/Store has the low bits as register number. So Jump only needs to encode 4 more bits.
            Now that may help if we try to pair jumps with other instructions a bit like MIPS does: CMP, Test .

<h3> Which logic family is the most clear?</h3>
<p>
    n FET logic is most simple. It benefits from space charge limited pull up . Pre-charge adds more clock which looks more like noise.

Voltage is signal. Black to blue. Bandgap should not hide voltage. Black on metal. Green. Switch color channels?

Doping only in insulator ( bright blue? ). Voltage goes through. So only one color channel left . With N FET I only need one doping polarity!

The space charge limiter shows how the field by doping is weaker than Vdd . No rail to rail signal
</p>
<p>
    n-fet only needs one (large) pull up transistor per (wired-or) trace.
</p>
<p>
    For totem poles to look good, I would need bending magnets. A full adder has these. The output from up to 3 transistors need to meet an one source.
    The direction needs to end up in the heat bath. So either diffusion, uh NS was supposed to diffuse only within the electrons. So I need a metal electrod!
    I found multiple example for swappable drain-source (small full adder, and the bus split in 6502 ). So better not to think about beam pentodes too much.
